# Hexagonal Lattice Boltzmann Simulation

This project implements a parallel and serial Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulation on a hexagonal lattice. It models fluid particle behavior across a 2D grid using discrete velocity directions. The simulation is parallelized using MPI for distributed computing and supports visualization via MATLAB.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Simulation Details

- **Lattice**: 2D hexagonal (6 directions)
- **Grid Size**: 300 √ó 100 nodes (configurable via constants)
- **Boundary Conditions**:
  - Slip on left/right
  - Dirichlet on top/bottom
- **Processes**: Domain decomposed across `x_nodes`
- **Timesteps**: 1000 (default)
- **Output**: One `.txt` file per timestep, named as `output{t}.txt`

## üöÄ Build Instructions

### Serial

```bash
gcc -O2 -o proj_serial serial.c
./proj_serial

Parallel (MPI)
mpicc -O2 -o proj_parallel parallel.c
mpirun -np <N_PROCESSES> ./proj_parallel
You can test locally using fewer processors or run on a cluster with SLURM.

‚òÅÔ∏è SLURM Usage
sbatch parallel.sh

Make sure to match --ntasks-per-node and -np in the script for consistent parallel runs.

üìÑ Output Format
Each output file (output{t}.txt) contains:

Number of x_nodes

Number of y_nodes

x_nodes √ó y_nodes rows of 6-bit binary strings, representing occupancy in each of 6 hex directions

üìä Visualization (MATLAB)
To visualize the simulation:

Open hex_visualize.m in MATLAB

Make sure abhilash.txt or outputX.txt is available

Run the script to render directional particle movement on the hexagonal grid

Modify the file path in fopen() if you're visualizing a different output.

üìà Performance Note
Each MPI process handles a chunk of x_nodes

Overlap communication + computation for better scaling

Initial domain setup includes dirichlet_in() injection and slip() boundaries

Suitable for benchmarking serial vs. parallel performance
